# Nexus-VR-Core
Nexus VR Core is a framework for assisting the development
of VR content on Roblox. The goal of Nexus VR Core is to
provide an implementation for pointing a SurfaceGuis without
additional overhead and improving ScreenGuis with minimal
additional overhead. This is because of the unreliability
of using ScreenGuis in VR and being able to only use the
right controller with SurfaceGuis without any visual guide,
and that is only under certain conditions.
